## VR menus: https://medium.com/@lucycarp/vr-menu-patterns-and-use-cases-f30fd8b5ef36

### Types of menu patterns
- floating menu: basically taking a traditional web menu and putting it in VR, this would probably be the easiest for us to implement but can break the fourth wall. usually used  in "intersitial" phases, like before moving to the next level of something, where the menu is the main focus.

- controller menu: where actions are mapped to controls specifically. flat buttons, sliders, etc.

- environment menu: interacting with objects in the environment (e.g., taking a "bite" out of pizza) produces actions. brings delight, these interactions aren't usually possible outside of VR. (i think our knobs fall under some combo of controller/environment)

- When your menu has 8 or more items: Use an object that allows you to present a GUI menu as part of that object
