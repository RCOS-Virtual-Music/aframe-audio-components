## Testing Environment
### Python
#### Setup
To get started, make sure you have the following installed: <br/>

+ Python 3.0	 (you can download it [here](www.python.org/downloads/))
+ NodeJS LTS (you can download it [here](http://nodejs.org))



#### Hosting the Basic Test Scene
First, download the basic A-Frame boilerplate [here](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-boilerplate/). Open up your command terminal and navigate to the directory that contains the boilerplate index.html file. Then, launch the server with `python -m http.server 8000`. This launches the server on your localhost on port 8000 (default). Open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) on any browser of your choosing and you should see the boilerplate scene.
