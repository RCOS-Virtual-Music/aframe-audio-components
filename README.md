## Testing Environment
### Python
#### Setup
To get started, make sure you have the following installed: <br/>

+ Python 3.0	 (you can download it [here](www.python.org/downloads/))
+ NodeJS LTS (you can download it [here](http://nodejs.org))



#### Hosting the Basic Test Scene
First, download the basic A-Frame boilerplate [here](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-boilerplate/). Open up your command terminal and navigate to the directory that contains the boilerplate index.html file. Then, launch the server with `python -m http.server 8000`. This launches the server on your localhost on port 8000 (default). Open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) on any browser of your choosing and you should see the boilerplate scene.

Live Server is a VS Code extension that allows you to launch a local development Server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages.
These instructions are for starting and running a server *if* you have a HTML file for your project. 

For serverside code such as `PHP`, `.NET` or `NodeJS` files, you will need to host your own server and additionally download the Live Server browser extension following [these instructions:](https://github.com/ritwickdey/live-server-web-extension/edit/master/docs/Setup.md)
